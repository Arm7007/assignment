    "In a big code , if there is an error at any line , while executing error occurs and because of a small error the complete code won't be able to run. To overcome that issue __EXCEPTION HANDLING__ is used. \n",

    "Syntax Error:\n",
    "- A syntax error occurs when the code violates the rules of the programming language. These errors typically prevent the code from being parsed or compiled because the syntax is incorrect.\n",
    "- Syntax errors are usually detected by the compiler or interpreter before the program is executed. Common examples include missing parentheses, using an undefined variable, or forgetting a semicolon at the end of a statement.\n",
    "- Since syntax errors prevent the code from being parsed or compiled, the program will not run until these errors are fixed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exception:\n",
    "- Exceptions occur during the execution of a program when an unexpected event or condition occurs that disrupts the normal flow of the program.\n",
    "- Exceptions are not necessarily caused by syntax errors; the code may be syntactically correct but still encounter an exception at runtime due to issues like division by zero, trying to access an index out of bounds in an array, or attempting to open a file that does not exist.\n",
    "- Unlike syntax errors, exceptions are typically detected while the program is running. When an exception is encountered, the program can respond to it by handling the exception gracefully (using try-catch blocks or similar mechanisms) or allow the program to terminate if the exception is not handled."
