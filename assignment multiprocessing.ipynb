    "While executing a big code, system may take more time and delay the output. To overcome this, multiprocessing is being used. In a system there are multiple processors (dual core : two processors, ocata core : eight processors etc), these processors are used simultaneously which ultimately imrove the speed of execution of code , resultantely reduce the time taken to excute the code by utelization of multipule processors of the system."

    "Multiprocessing and multithreading are both techniques used to achieve concurrent execution, but they differ in their approach and use cases. Here are the key differences between them:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Process vs. Thread\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiprocessing: Involves multiple processes. Each process has its own memory space, resources, and execution context. Processes run independently and are managed by the operating system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multithreading: Involves multiple threads within a single process. Threads share the same memory space and resources but have their own execution contexts. They are managed by the runtime environment or the operating system.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Memory Management\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiprocessing: Each process has its own separate memory space. This isolation helps avoid conflicts and makes processes more robust, as one process crashing doesn’t affect others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multithreading: Threads share the same memory space and resources of their parent process. This can lead to issues like race conditions if multiple threads access shared data concurrently without proper synchronization.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Performance and Overhead\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiprocessing: Typically incurs more overhead because of the need for process creation and inter-process communication (IPC). However, it can utilize multiple CPUs or cores effectively, as processes run in parallel on separate CPUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multithreading: Generally has lower overhead compared to multiprocessing because threads are lighter weight and share the same memory. However, because threads share memory, managing concurrency can become complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Inter-Process Communication (IPC) vs. Thread Communication\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiprocessing: Requires IPC mechanisms like pipes, queues, or shared memory for processes to communicate with each other. IPC can be slower due to the need for serialization and synchronization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multithreading: Communication between threads is simpler since they share the same memory space. Threads can directly access shared variables and data structures, but this requires careful synchronization to avoid data corruption.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiprocessing: Ideal for tasks that require significant CPU resources and are independent of each other. Suitable for parallelizing tasks that are CPU-bound and need true parallelism, such as complex calculations or data processing tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multithreading: Suitable for I/O-bound tasks or tasks that involve waiting (e.g., network operations, file operations). It’s often used in applications where responsiveness and efficiency are critical, such as web servers or applications with a lot of concurrent operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Fault Tolerance\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiprocessing: More fault-tolerant because processes are isolated from each other. If one process crashes, it doesn’t necessarily affect other processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multithreading: Less fault-tolerant because threads within the same process are more interdependent. A crash or bug in one thread can potentially affect the entire process."
